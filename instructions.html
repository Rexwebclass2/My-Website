<h1>1.Downloading Windows 10</h1>

<p>Make Sure Your OS Is Compatible</p>
<p>Anything Below Windows 7 Is Not Compatible</p>
<p>To Check, Visit Run (An App Preinstalled) And Type: winver</p>
<p>If It Says, Windows XP, Or Windows Vista (It Just Has To Say Those Words) Then You Can't Upgrade, First Upgrade To Win 8.1 or 7</p>
<p>If It Says, Windows 7, Or Windows 8/8.1 Then You Can Upgrade (Same, It Just Has To Say Those Words)</p>
<h1>2.Installing Windows 10</h1>
<p>Open File Explorer Once It's Finished, Double Click On The ISO, If It Says Windows, Wait For It To Load, Then Look At The Name On The Close/Minimize/Fullscreen Bar</p>
<p>If It Asks You To Burn To Disk, Then Get A USB Or SD Or Any Type Of Storage Device, And Then Plug It In</p>
<p>Click Refresh (If You Don't See Refresh But You See The Drive Follow Along, Don't See Ether? Click Close And Double Click Again)</p>
<p>Other Way? Look At 64-bit Or 32-bit On The Setup. If You Know Your Computer Is 64-bit Then Countinue If You Know It's 32-bit, Then Uncheck The Check, And Chose 32-bit</p>
<p>Not Sure? Go To: Control Panel/System/System Info/ And Look Around For A 32-bit Or 64-bit</p>
