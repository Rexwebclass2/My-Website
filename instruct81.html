<h1>Install Windows 8.1</h1>
<p>It's Basically The Same Thing As Windows 10</p>  
<p>I Would Recomend The Media Creation Tool</p>
<p>Download A Media Creation Tool For Windows 8.1 By Google Search</p>
<p>Get An 4 GB USB Or A 4 GB CD Or SD</p>
<p>Then, Plug It In And Start The Windows 8.1 Media Creation Tool</p>
<p>Select The Version Of The Computer (Most Likely: 64-bit) And Countinue</p>
<p>Then, Click USB If You Have A USB Or ISO File If You Have The Other</p>
<p>For SD Or DVD Users, Copy The ISO File To The SD Or DVD And Follow Along</p>
<p>Wait For It To Install, Then Reboot Your Computer And On Startup, Press F8 Or F12</p>
<p>Use Arrow Keys To Select Your USB, Or SD Or DVD And Enter To Select</p>
<p>It Will Boot, Probobly</p>
<p>Make Sure You Have Your Product Key Ready</p>  
<p>Also, You Don't Need To Do All That, But You Might Need To,</p>
<p>Worth A Shot, Double-Click The ISO File And If A Menu Opens That Has Files In It, Then Well Done</p>
<p>Double-Click The File Called "setup.exe" And Follow Along The Setup</p>
<p>You Will Need A Product Key</p>
